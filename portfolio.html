    <h1>   Our project is a simulation of a customer’s experience at Pepe’s Pizzeria. The user can select size, crust thickness, sauce, topping options, and cooking time of their pizza through the console. We utilized Python’s background image options to make our program more realistic to the user as well as images to replicate the pizzeria experience.</h1>

    <h1>   My second project is called Rocket Blast.</h1>
    <br>
    <h1>   We placed our rocket on the bottom of the screen and gave it the ability to move left and right, but not up and down. The meteors fall down from the top of the screen in random locations. Everytime the game player misses a meteor, the score decreases. The game player can shoot lasers at the meteors to destroy them. The score increases when the user destroys a meteor. The user has 30 seconds to get as many points as possible.
